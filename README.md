A GoogleLens-adjacent app for translating screenshots on your desktop. Most useful for translating in situations where text is not copy+paste-able.

Simply take a screenshot on your computer, and the app will:

 -translate it 

 -overlay the translated text on the screenshot 

 -provide a copy+paste-able version of the original text and the translated text.


Currently only supports Japanese -> English, but many more languages are to come.

**Requires an OpenAI API key:** To use this software, you'll need to input an OpenAI API key in the options menu. It is stored locally on your computer, so it is not shared with anyone except yourself.
